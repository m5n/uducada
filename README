uducada = UI Development Using Class and Data Attributes

A JavaScript library for building fully-featured UIs.
Simply use predefined markup and class attributes.
No additional JavaScript coding required.

First checkin: Friday, April 13, 2012

Principles:
- user-facing strings belong in HTML
- JS script tags belong just before the end-body tag

uducada = UI Development Using Class and Data Attributes
(Obviously still a work in progress.)

This project enhances UI development with jQuery UI via markup-driven widget configuration and commonly used interaction techniques.

By using specific markup, class attributes and data attributes, UI development is simplified and UI consistency is improved.  Widgets will become purely event driven and the only JavaScript needed will be to handle those events.
Because of these rules, it's very easy to create your own helper functions to spit out this markup based on some options you pass in.

Principles:
- CSS and JS go in external files, never inline or nested within the HTML
  (the included demos violate only this principle as their purpose is educational)
- <link> tags go in the <head>, <script> tags go just before </body>
- User-facing strings go in HTML, never in CSS or JS
- Widget config is done via standard and valid HTML attributes whenever possible
  or via custom data attributes otherwise
- Visibility of elements is not treated as a widget configuration option and is
  done via custom class attribute values to allow a pure CSS implementation
- Variable names are non-abbreviated for clarity; minification will keep the
  file size in check
- Support delayed initialization of widgets

uducada = UI Development Using Class and Data Attributes
(Obviously still a work in progress.)

This project enhances UI development with jQuery UI via markup-driven widget configuration and commonly used interaction techniques.

By using specific markup, class attributes and data attributes, UI development is simplified and UI consistency is improved.  Widgets will become purely event driven and the only JavaScript needed will be to handle those events.

Principles:
- user-facing strings belong in HTML
- JS script tags belong just before </body>
